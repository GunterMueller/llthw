Programming is hard.  Anyone who says differently is either trying to make you feel inferior or sell you something.  In the case of "easy-to-learn" programming languages, both cases happen to be true.  But you're not here for inefficient, glorified, instant-gratification scripting languages that pigeon-hole you into prescribed execution control-flows and common use-cases.  You're not here for monolithic imperative languages that have to be tamed into submission for the simplest tasks.  You've sought out *the Hard Way*, and the hardest language to master, Common Lisp.  You're not afraid of working for what you want or committing to a new way of thinking---you're here because you want to be a Lisp Hacker, and you're not going to let anything get in your way.

That being said, learning Lisp is not an impossible dream.  Like any skill, practice makes perfect---and that's what *the Hard Way* is all about.  You don't have to be a genius or Black Hat to crack the mystery surrounding the language and the open-source subculture where it thrives.  You just have to follow a few essential steps, and apply them without fail.  Lisp may seem like an ancient mystical secret, cherished and protected by an impenetrable brotherhood of hacker elites, but that, much like the language's popular association solely with Artificial Intelligence applications, is a misconception.  The biggest secret to Lisp is that it is actually the simplest programming language ever created---and that, coupled with its expressiveness and elegance, is why it is favored exclusively by the best programmers in the world.  With hard work, attention to detail, and careful reflection over the subject material, you will be up and running with Lisp and writing real applications much earlier than you could with other, lesser languages.

## The Hard Way is Easier

Whatever you think you know about programming, forget it.  Lisp is different from other programming languages.

If you're coming to Lisp as an experienced developer, it is only fair to tell you upfront that your experience will hold you back.  It will make you feel bored when the material isn't "challenging you".  It will make you skip over sections you think you already understand.  It will tell you reading the code examples once is enough to learn it, that it's okay to copy-and-paste.  But none of this is true---and if you slack off now, you'll only be making things harder for yourself later.

No matter who you are or what your background is, if you stick to the steps of learning the hard way, you'll see that it is actually easier in the long run.  You'll have to work hard, but you'll learn what you need to learn the first time, and you won't forget it.

Learning the hard way means following these five steps every day until you've completed this book:

1. Forget everything you know
2. Work through each exercise from beginning to end
3. Type in each example *exactly*
4. Make the code run
5. Reflect on what you've seen

And that is all.

Depending on your level of self-discipline, you may have a more difficult time sticking to these steps than some---but this isn't a contest.  Don't worry about how long it takes you to work through an exercise, don't panic if you have to miss a day, and don't compare yourself to others.  If you do your best to apply these steps every day, you will develop the self-discipline required to see this book through to the end.

An important theme of this book is also on the skills necessary for programming in general, while using Lisp to reinforce them.  These skills are: reading and writing, mathematics, attention to detail, and spotting differences.  Thus, once you finish this book, you won't just be a Lisp Hacker, you'll be ready to tackle other programming languages too---and in the process you might just discover that learning a new skill is more fun than any hobby, game, movie, or tv show.
