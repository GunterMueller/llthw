# Exercise 1.2.4

## Characters

Strings are sequences of characters.  In Lisp, characters are proper objects in their own right, and have their own distinct representation to the Lisp reader.  Characters are referred to as "unitary tokens" in the ANSI Common Lisp standard.

At the REPL, you can use the Sharpsign-Backquote syntax to refer to a literal character object. Most of the characters you can type with your keymap set to US-English are typed by entering the sharpsign-backslash followed by the character itself. Some characters also have names so that they are easier to type:

```lisp
#\a
#\A
#\Space
#\Newline
#\Tab
#\greek_small_letter_lamda
```

Notice that some character names are case-sensitive. Typing `#\a` gives you the lower-case letter <em>a</em> character object, while typing `#\A` gives you the upper-case letter <em>A</em> character object, just as you would expect.

Characters outside the ASCII standard are typed using their Unicode name, with underscores for word-separators.  These names are not case-sensitive: you could type `#\Greek_Small_Letter_Lamda`, `#\GREEK_SMALL_LETTER_LAMDA`, or even `#\gReEK_sMaLl_LeTtER_lAmDA`, and the Lisp reader will see it the same---for style and legibility of your code, however, you should stick with the lower-case names. You can use this syntax to enter any Unicode character into the REPL.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>Note:</strong>
  <p>You've probably noticed that the Greek letter lambda's name is "misspelled" in the example above. It's not a mistake, this is the actual character name in the Unicode standard, because the name of the letter is no longer spelled with the letter <em>beta</em> following the <em>mu</em> in modern Greek.</p>
  <p>This is a good opportunity to remind you to type in exactly, character for character, what I have in the example code into the REPL. Did you get an error when typing the above example? Check what you typed, and make sure you typed exactly what you're supposed to.</p>
</div>

As it turns out, you can easily get a list of characters from a string.  Try this out:

```lisp
(coerce "hello, multiverse!" 'list)
```

#### What You Should See

```lisp
* #\a
#\a
* #\A
#\A
* #\Space
#\
* #\Newline
#\Newline
* #\Tab
#\Tab
* #\greek_small_letter_lamda
#\GREEK_SMALL_LETTER_LAMDA
* (coerce "hello, multiverse!" 'list)
(#\h #\e #\l #\l #\o #\, #\  #\m #\u #\l #\t #\i #\v #\e #\r #\s #\e #\!)
```
