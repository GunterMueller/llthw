## Exercise 1.2.4

# Characters

**Revision Note:** maybe mention that `#\Space` is a graphic character object, and the implications of that.

Strings are *specialized vectors* of element-type *character*.  In Lisp, these character elements are atomic, self-evaluating objects in their own right, and have a distinct syntax that is not always the same as the glyph used to represent them in a string.  Characters are referred to as "unitary tokens" in the ANSI Common Lisp standard.

At the REPL, you can use the Sharpsign-Backquote syntax to refer to a literal character object. Most of the characters that you can type with your keymap set to US-English can be entered using the sharpsign-backslash followed by the character itself. Some characters also have names so that they are easier to type:

```lisp
#\a
#\A
#\Space
#\Newline
#\Tab
```

Notice that some character names are case-sensitive. Typing `#\a` gives you the lower-case letter <em>a</em> character object, while typing `#\A` gives you the upper-case letter <em>A</em> character object, just as you would expect.

As it turns out, you can easily get a list of characters from a string.  Try this out:

```lisp
(coerce "hello, multiverse!" 'list)
```

#### What You Should See

```lisp
* #\a
#\a
* #\A
#\A
* #\Space
#\
* #\Newline
#\Newline
* #\Tab
#\Tab
* (coerce "hello, multiverse!" 'list)
(#\h #\e #\l #\l #\o #\, #\  #\m #\u #\l #\t #\i #\v #\e #\r #\s #\e #\!)
```
