# Exercise 1.2.4

## Characters

Strings are sequences of characters.  In Lisp, characters are proper objects in their own right, and have their own distinct representation to the Lisp reader.  Characters are referred to as "unitary tokens" in the ANSI Common Lisp standard.

At the REPL, you can use the Sharpsign-Backquote syntax to refer to a literal character object. Most of the characters you can type with your keymap set to US-English are typed by entering the sharpsign-backslash followed by the character itself. Some characters also have names so that they are easier to type:

```lisp
#\a
#\A
#\Space
#\Newline
#\Tab
```

Notice that some character names are case-sensitive. Typing `#\a` gives you the lower-case letter <em>a</em> character object, while typing `#\A` gives you the upper-case letter <em>A</em> character object, just as you would expect.

As it turns out, you can easily get a list of characters from a string.  Try this out:

```lisp
(coerce "hello, multiverse!" 'list)
```

#### What You Should See

```lisp
* #\a
#\a
* #\A
#\A
* #\Space
#\
* #\Newline
#\Newline
* #\Tab
#\Tab
* (coerce "hello, multiverse!" 'list)
(#\h #\e #\l #\l #\o #\, #\  #\m #\u #\l #\t #\i #\v #\e #\r #\s #\e #\!)
```
