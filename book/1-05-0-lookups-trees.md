## Chapter 1.5 --- Extra Credit

# Look-up Lists and Trees

> "Take sides! Always take sides! You will sometimes be wrong&mdash;but the man who refuses to take sides must <em>always</em> be wrong."

In addition to the typical lists you saw throughout the exercises of the previous chapter, Lisp also has a couple special types of look-up lists that have more structure than just position.  They are called Association Lists and Property Lists, or `alists` and `plists` for short.  They are typically used for data and not code, because they both consist of key--value pairs; but this is Lisp, after all, so there are packages where these special data lists are repurposed as code, and later on you'll see how to do similar things yourself if you ever need or want to.

If you have never come across the concept of key--value pair data structures before, they are straightforward to use and understand---all they do is assign a value you specify to a keyword, so that you can add them to a list and get the value back later by name instead of having to remember where in the list you put the value.  They are the basis for all structured data, including types such as Hash Tables, Structs, Classes, Database Tables, and more, all of which we'll be covering in this book.

This chapter will contain exercises on:

* Examples of ALISTS and PLISTS
* Creating PLISTS
* Adding items to PLISTS
* Changing values in PLISTS
* Removing items from PLISTS
* Creating ALISTS
* Adding items to ALISTS
* Removing items from ALISTS
* Practical size-constraints for ALISTS and PLISTS, alternate data types to look out for.
* Trees
* Acyclic Graphs
