Scientific computing, also known as Computational Science, is now considered a third mode of science in addition to the traditional two modes of observation/experimentation and theory, and is thus an essential basic skill for researchers of every scientific field.  Typically, computational scientists favour R, Mathematica, MATLAB, Python's SciPy and PDL libraries, C, or Fortran to implement highly optimized numerical simulations; but Common Lisp has significant advantages over all these technologies for implementing robust, optimized, distributed algorithms for modelling scientific problems, running simulations, and further optimizing scenarios.

---

Focus on GSLL, CL-PLPlot, other math and plotting libraries; distributed and parallel computation; GPU programming for floating-point calculations; optimization problems.  Advantages over R, C, Fortran for computational science.

Translate common problems in scientific computing from psuedo-code into Lisp, work from the REPL, compare against Mathematica, MatLab, etc.
