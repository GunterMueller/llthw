# A Simple LispOS

**Note:** *the exercises in this chapter may require an additional computer to complete, and due to the prohibitive cost and lack of availability for some readers, it should be considered optional*.

The elegance, power, and expressiveness of Lisp often encourages students of the language to wish for a more complete, live hackable, Lisp-based environment that extends beyond the Emacs+SLIME development environment; they usually start with either a Lisp-based window manager, such as StumpWM, or replacing their command-line shell with the Lisp REPL, and then quickly come to the conclusion, "why can't the whole operating system be written in Lisp?"  Well, it's not quite so easy as that... but it is still very much in the realm of possibility.

If you already run a Linux-based Operating System, you can start by just replacing pieces of your distro one-by-one with Lisp-based equivalents; but it is probably much safer if you use a spare computer, or a virtual machine, so that if anything goes wrong you won't lose any personal data.

Will need a spare PC/Linux box that can be scrapped if you screw up.

Show how to strip out key Linux components, replacing them with Lisp, packages for replacing the shell, installing and using StumpWM, etc.
