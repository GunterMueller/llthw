# Configuring Your Development Environment

> "Relevant quote..."
> <footer>Source</footer>

Now that you've gotten yourself a feel for Common Lisp, you'll want to spend a little time configuring your development environment so that you can dive right into the code.  A lot of configuration choices are a matter of personal taste, but as long as you feel comfortable, and nothing interferes with your ability to learn and hack in Lisp, you can't really go wrong.

## The In-Browser REPL

You can start hacking in Lisp right away with the in-browser, javascript-powered REPL right next to the text of this book.  It stays where it is while you browse through the chapters and learn the language.

That being said, JSCL is far from complete and not all the code examples will run; to get the most out of your Lisp experience, you will want to install Common Lisp on your computer, and run all the examples in this book through it.

## Installing SBCL

Steel Bank Common Lisp is one of the easiest Lisp implementations to get up and running&mdash;it has out of the box support for a wide selection of platforms, and is considered to be the most robust implementation available.  Since it automatically compiles everything you enter at the REPL, your running Lisp processes also benefit from a major speed-boost over other Lisps.
