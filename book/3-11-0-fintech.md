# Financial Software and Crypto-Currencies

> "'Value' has no meaning other than in relationship to living beings... This very personal relationship, 'value', has two factors... first, what he can do with a thing, its use to him... and second, what he must do to get it, its <em>cost</em> to him."

Out of all the commercial ventures available to a budding entrepreneur, the most dangerous undertaking is handling other people's money.  Not just for the obvious reasons, such as becoming a target for theft, exploitation, and blackmail---but the liability alone, the stifling regulatory systems, and compliance requirements make the financial industry a deeply uncomfortable place for newcomers.  With this in mind, you can wonder at the audacity of the Bitcoin and crypto-currency community, that has spearheaded a new digital economy without taking such factors into consideration; and then realize why so many Bitcoin companies are failing.  The biggest problem may be self-evident to certain people, but is not often discussed---Bitcoin was specifically designed to sabotage the financial industry through total decentralization, not to be used as a tool to build banks and other money service businesses for cheap.
