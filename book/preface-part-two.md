# The Hard Way Is Easier

> ""
> <footer></footer>

Whatever you think you know about programming, forget it.  Lisp is different from other programming languages.

If you're coming to Lisp as an experienced developer, it is only fair to tell you upfront that your experience will hold you back.  It will make you feel bored when the material isn't "challenging you".  It will make you skip over sections you think you already understand.  It will tell you reading the code examples once is enough to learn it, that it's okay to copy-and-paste.  But none of this is true---and if you slack off now, you'll only be making things harder for yourself later.

No matter who you are or what your background is, if you stick to the steps of learning the hard way, you'll see that it is actually easier in the long run.  You'll have to work hard, but you'll learn what you need to learn the first time, and you won't forget it.

Learning the hard way means following these five steps every day until you've completed this book:

1. Forget everything you know
2. Work through each exercise from beginning to end
3. Type in each example *exactly*
4. Make the code run
5. Reflect on what you've seen

And that is all.

Depending on your level of self-discipline, you may have a more difficult time sticking to these steps than some---but this isn't a contest.  Don't worry about how long it takes you to work through an exercise, don't panic if you have to miss a day, and don't compare yourself to others.  If you do your best to apply these steps every day, you will develop the self-discipline required to see this book through to the end.

An important theme of this book is also on the skills necessary for programming in general, while using Lisp to reinforce them.  These skills are: reading and writing, mathematics, attention to detail, and spotting differences.  Thus, once you finish this book, you won't just be a Lisp Hacker, you'll be ready to tackle other programming languages too---and in the process you might just discover that learning a new skill is more fun than any hobby, game, movie, or tv show.
