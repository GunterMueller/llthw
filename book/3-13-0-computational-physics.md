While Computational Science is generally useful for all scientific disciplines, as it allows scientists to refine and improve established theories and models to better match the observed data, computational science is of *fundamental importance* to Physicists, as it allows them to model underlying systems *which cannot yet be observed*; thus, the highly specialized branch of computational science dealing primarily with theoretical physics has its own name, Computational Physics, and is often treated as its own field.  As a third modality of science, the results of computational simulations of these underlying physical systems can be used in lieu of observation and experiment to aid in the validation of various theories; and naturally, to aid in the modelling of experiments so that the more exotic phenomenon in theoretical physics can be observed, if the theories correctly predict the behaviour and nature of these systems.
