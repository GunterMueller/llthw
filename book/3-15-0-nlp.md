# Natural Language Processing

Creating a programming language and writing a compiler for it is one thing; analyzing human speech is quite another.  Computer languages rely on precision, rigorous formal definitions, unambiguous code that compiles down to precise machine instructions; natural human languages rely on allusions, metaphors, nuances, idioms, and unspoken body language---writing is therefore an artform, and not a science, as it takes a very special sort of person to convey the vast wealth of human interactions in the limited medium of the written word, allowing all readers to experience their emotions and perceptions.  But *all programmers* are expected to convey the degree of precision that a computer expects.

The LISP family, and other programming languages that support the functional paradigm, bridges this gap between human language and computer language slightly better than the purely imperative, algorithmic programming languages; as we have already covered, in Lisp you can tell the computer *what you want* instead of having to tell it *what to do*, and this logical implementation of the all-too-human concept of *intent* makes all the difference when tackling the problem of Natural Language Processing.

Overview of Lisp software for speech recognition, text-based natural language processing, etc.

NLP/NLTK:

* CL-LangUtils
* CL-NLP/CL-NLTK

Speech Recognition libraries:

* Julius
* CMU Sphinx
* Built-in Speech Recognition in Windows and OS X
* Dragon Mobile SDK, HTTP Interface

Good opportunity to write a practical, full-scale FFI lib as part of the book.  Dragon Mobile SDK, HTTP Interface better to introduce core concepts of speech recognition.
