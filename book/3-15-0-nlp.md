**Revision Note:** *Trim down the intro text to bare-minimum, focus on Common Lisp tools for NLP.*

**Proposed revision to intro text:**

Creating a programming language and writing a compiler for it is one thing; analyzing human speech is quite another.  Computer languages rely on precision, rigorous formal definitions, unambiguous code that compiles down to exact machine instructions; natural human languages rely on allusions, metaphors, nuances, idioms, and unspoken body language---writing is therefore an art-form, and not a science, as it takes a very special sort of person to convey the vast wealth of human interactions in the limited medium of the written word, allowing all readers to experience their emotions and perceptions.  But *all programmers* are expected to convey the degree of precision that a computer expects.

In this chapter, we will review the current state of NLP as a field of research and the libraries available in Common Lisp for writing NLP software; we will explore the challenges of speech-recognition and leverage existing tools and APIs for transforming speech to text; and we will write a general purpose library for creating meaningful abstract syntax trees from English, to attempt to write Lisp software using natural, conversational language.

**Deprecated version of intro text:**

Creating a programming language and writing a compiler for it is one thing; analyzing human speech is quite another.  Computer languages rely on precision, rigorous formal definitions, unambiguous code that compiles down to exact machine instructions; natural human languages rely on allusions, metaphors, nuances, idioms, and unspoken body language---writing is therefore an art-form, and not a science, as it takes a very special sort of person to convey the vast wealth of human interactions in the limited medium of the written word, allowing all readers to experience their emotions and perceptions.  But *all programmers* are expected to convey the degree of precision that a computer expects.  To make these points clear, in the most human possible way, allow me to draw on metaphor---no one expects any author, however talented, to be able to compete with the likes of Shakespeare, because his vision was singular, his expression of raw human emotion unmatched, and his ability to *create* words and expressions that still to this day perfectly capture the full range of the human experience stand in a transcendent literary class of their own; but every programmer is expected to be a Shakespeare of programming, to write code that not only does exactly what it is supposed to do, but is expressed in the perfect way---aesthetically pleasing to the eye, understandable at a glance, and optimized for maximum performance.

Now imagine, for a moment, the terrifying challenge it would be to attempt to accurately parse a Shakespearean play using Natural Language Processing software.  The LISP family, and other programming languages that support the functional paradigm, bridges the gap between human language and computer language slightly better than the purely imperative, algorithmic programming languages; as we have already covered, in Lisp you can tell the computer *what you want* instead of having to tell it *what to do*, and this logical implementation of the all-too-human concept of *intent* makes all the difference when tackling the problem of Natural Language Processing, a necessary tool to even approach such powerful emotional and associative language as used by the Great Bard.

That being said, the field of NLP still poses many challenges to developers---the sheer number of dialects, accents, and languages currently in use just on this planet by our species alone is staggering; and all of them keep evolving from one generation to the next.  While the field of Linguistics has made great strides to formulating a theory of universal grammar, a key to unlocking the underlying mechanism of speech and language comprehension in humans, we know very little about the mechanisms of communication in other species on this planet.  We know that all animal life forms communicate with members of their own species *somehow*, but since such a large percentage of *our species* assumes that we are the only sentient species in the entire universe, it is further assumed that this is not a problem worth solving; yet, it has been recently discovered that all Mammalian life on Earth share a consistent underlying *emotional* language---and this implies that if we are to build a 'universal' natural language processor, it stands to reason that we build it on top of the underlying language that we *know* we all share, regardless of the words and grammatical structures we choose to express ourselves.  This approach does not directly solve the issue of analyzing the thousands of distinct dialects, accents, and languages currently in use on the planet today; but at least it implies the potential for a shared framework in which all human languages *can be* accurately analyzed by a computer, to the same degree of precision available to a human being.

A basic understanding of human psychology and neuroscience may also be of service to developers working in the field of Natural Language Processing; after all, there is a significant relationship between the psychology of an individual and the language(s) they speak, and it has further been demonstrated that a child who learns multiple languages in the formative stages of development perform better on average in intelligence and aptitude tests than children who only learn a single language.  In the field of Linguistics, one further discovers the sheer wealth of differing perspectives encapsulated in each human language; *what a language can express, and how it expresses it, shape's a person's perspectives, thoughts, and identity*, just as much as a person's perspectives, thoughts, and identity shapes their behaviour.  This theory was explored in depth in George Orwell's infamous dystopian novel, Nineteen Eighty-Four, where the totalitarian government in the story was purposefully reshaping the English language into Newspeak, to make it impossible for the populace to even conceive of disobedience.  The corollary of this theory is that children who learn multiple languages early enough learn to embrace multiple unconventional perspectives as a fundamental cornerstone of their psychology and identity, and are thus more capable of embracing new ideas, integrating new information, and thus learning.

Who knew how powerful a tool language could be?  Certainly, six-thousand years ago, when the ancient Sumerians first crossed the massive psychological barrier that transformed speech into writing, they could not have known just how far their cherished Mystical Art of the Scribes would take the human race---for now, it is considered a basic right and responsibility of all humans to read and write; and it is also now considered essential for every human being to know how to program a computer.  In this context, perhaps you can now better understand the importance of Natural Language Processing---a computer that can *actually* understand exactly what you mean, so that you can interact with it just as you would interact with a person.  This is the ultimate interface, and the ultimate user experience; perfect integration of computers with human psychology.  Common Lisp bridges the gap between human psychology and computational logic *just enough* to make this goal feasible.

In this chapter, we will review the current state of NLP as a field of research and the libraries available in Common Lisp for writing NLP software; we will explore the challenges of speech-recognition and leverage existing tools and APIs for transforming speech to text; and we will write a general purpose library for creating meaningful abstract syntax trees from English, to attempt to write Lisp software using natural, conversational language.  As an extra credit exercise, we will further explore the theory of an underlying emotional Mammalian language, and attempt to derive an adaptable NLP system that recognizes human emotions in spoken language and responds accordingly.

Overview of Lisp software for speech recognition, text-based natural language processing, etc.

NLP/NLTK:

* CL-LangUtils
* CL-NLP/CL-NLTK

Speech Recognition libraries:

* Julius
* CMU Sphinx
* Built-in Speech Recognition in Windows and OS X
* Dragon Mobile SDK, HTTP Interface

Good opportunity to write a practical, full-scale FFI lib as part of the book.  Dragon Mobile SDK, HTTP Interface better to introduce core concepts of speech recognition.
