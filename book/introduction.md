# Lisp, a Future History

> "A generation which ignores history has no past---and no future."
> <footer>Robert A. Heinlein, Time Enough For Love</footer>

Many of the books about Common Lisp currently available on the market start off with a review of Lisp's history.  This is sensible, being that the Lisp family of languages has such a long and rich lineage, there is much to tell.  Rather than present another take on the past, however, I wish to share my vision for the future of Lisp.  If the history of the Lisp language and its community interests you, which it should, please check out the many fine books listed under the Resources section of this site.
