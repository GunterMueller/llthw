# Lisp, a Future History

> "A generation which ignores history has no past---and no future."
> <footer>Robert A. Heinlein, Time Enough For Love</footer>

Many of the books about Common Lisp currently available on the market start off with a review of Lisp's history.  This is sensible, being that the Lisp family of languages has such a long and rich lineage, there is much to tell.  Rather than present another take on the past, however, I wish to share my vision for the future of Lisp.  If the history of the Lisp language and its community interests you, which it should, please check out the many fine books listed under the Resources section of this site.

## A Technology Driven Culture

Human society has always been a technology-driven culture.  Stop and think about this for a moment---in every period of history, society was driven by innovation, ever since the very beginning of history when the ancient Sumerians first began carving words into clay tablets, to capture and preserve the fleeting vocalizations that would otherwise be lost in time, as soon as they had been spoken.  Even that innovation was not enough for them---they kept pushing the boundaries of what writing could do, from the very first accounting records and receipts to the first epic, the hero's journey of Gilgamesh.

We are no different today---we build on the work of those who came before us, we adapt and modify what already exists to suit our needs at the time, and sometimes, we stumble upon an innovation so important that it changes the world.  John McCarthy's first paper on Lisp was such an innovation.

## Programming Languages Today

Today, Common Lisp---the most widely used of all Lisp-family languages---is still setting the standard in the programming world, as no other language has yet come to match it in terms of speed, expressiveness, interactivity, and features.  Every so often, a new programming language comes out, or a new version of an old one, boasting about there new, game-changing feature sets or innovations; meanwhile, Lisp Hackers are having a private chuckle amongst themselves, because Lisp has had that feature for decades.

Consider Swift, Python, C++11, and the latest version of Java.  All of them have been boasting recently about such-and-such great new feature, while all of them were established in the ANSI standardization of Common Lisp in the 80s, plus countless more.  Lisp Hackers have had decades to use these feature sets, and push innovation even farther than any other language can.

But because of the popular opinion out in the world that Lisp is old and crufty, or too difficult to learn for the average programmer, the Lisp community has gotten smaller and smaller.  Companies get scared when Lisp is pitched as the technology for a project.  Safe choices like C, Java, .NET, Ruby, or Python are preferred, despite the many disadvantages, notorious bugginess, etc.

But a number of companies around the world have changed their tune---they're tired of paying for proprietary platforms, languages, and IDEs, riddled with bugs which need constant, daily security patches.  They're tired of building their product line in a language so unstable that they have to rewrite large sections of code every time there is one of these updates.  They're tired of feeling like every new programming language is just a new form of snake-oil.  They want a platform that works everywhere the same, they want to write code that doesn't break between security updates, they want to build a product that stands the test of time.  And as a result, more and more companies are turning to Lisp for answers---the only problem now is that there aren't enough Lisp Hackers to go around.

## The Lisp Community

The Lisp community, albeit relatively small compared to languages such as Python or Haskell, is a much friendlier place.  Mostly because the Lisp language is itself inclusive, supporting every programming paradigm in the world, and allowing Lisp Hackers to create and implement their own paradigms easily.
