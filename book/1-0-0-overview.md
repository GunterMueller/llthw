# PART ONE: Grokking Lisp

> "'Grok' means to understand so thoroughly that the observer becomes a part of the process being observed—to merge, to blend, to intermarry, to lose personal identity in group experience. It means almost everything that we mean by religion, philosophy, and science—and it means as little to us as color means to a blind man."

Lisp isn't a language you just *learn*.  It changes you, as a programmer and a person.

In Part One, we focus on the core of the Common Lisp language, features that you will use every day, and techniques that will change the way you see programming.
