Reverse Engineering is an art, more than a science---that being said, it is also a highly skilled area that requires a deep understanding of all aspects of computer science.  While this chapter will cover the essential techniques to reverse engineer software using the Common Lisp language, it does not attempt to teach the methodology or theory behind reverse engineering.
