# Cross-Platform Desktop Applications

Assuming your target user-base is not comprised entirely of Lisp Hackers, your users will not be interested in receiving a source-code distribution; they will expect a binary distribution that can be installed and uninstalled, and an interface to your app that is familiar.  This means a few different things---first, that your application's UI *looks* like other applications; it *works* like other applications; and it fits into the Operating System like all other applications.

In Common Lisp, there are a lot of choices to provide desktop graphical user interfaces; but GUI applications are still a lot of work, and need to be carefully designed to support cross-platform deployment.

---

Discuss Smoke/QT bindings, LTK, McCLIM, SDL + Dormouse, LispWorks CAPI, etc.

LTK for developing rapid cross-platform guis.

Develop a cross-platform LTK app for OS X, Windows, and Linux, package it for each OS appropriately.

Note: consider a wrapper around Atom-Shell, for writing rapid web technology based cross-platform applications.
