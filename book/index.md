FAQ
---

How long does this book take to complete?

: You should take as long as you need with each module to fully grasp the material.  It's not a race, and the only deadlines are the ones you set for yourself.

: Assuming you already have some programming experience and can do at least one module a day, you should expect to spend at least three months.

What kind of computer do I need?

: Common Lisp is available for nearly every platform, so any personal computer should do.
