# Exercise 1.2.9

## More Printing

As I said in the previous exercise, Common Lisp has a lot of functions for printing, including one named `print`, which you'll see here in this exercise.  I'll also show you how the same functionality can be implemented with `write`, so you can get a feel for specializing a very general interface---a common development pattern in Common Lisp.
