# Neuroscience and Thought-Controlled Computing

**Note:** *the exercises in this chapter will require specialized hardware components to complete, and due to the prohibitive cost and lack of availability for some readers, it should be considered optional*.

Affordable Brain--Computer Interfaces are a relatively new thing.  They are not *new* in terms of actual technological innovation, being based on EEG systems that have existed for decades, but the application of specialized medical and scientific equipment to the average computer user as a potential replacement for the old-fashioned keyboard and mouse *is* quite novel.

---

Specialized hardware required, such as Emotiv EPOC, Interaxon Muse, etc.

Parsing brain-wave data in Lisp, structuring Neural-net models, etc.

Write a brain-wave controlled utility.  Replacement for keyboard or mouse, for example.  Maybe mapping Emacs commands to brain-waves?
