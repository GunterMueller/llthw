### Strings and Printing

You can print any string using the `print` function.  In the REPL, this string is also returned, so it has the effect of printing it twice---once to `*standard-output*` as instructed by the `print` function, and once as the printed representation of the function's return value for the REPL interface.

`(print "Hello, world!")`

`(print "This is a string")`
